this tester is pure airplane

the transision from walking to flight should be a cannon

when crashed on the ground, go back to walking

when in airplane mode, rotate the camera up

the head's orientation will need to be treated like a tail - or canard

----------------------------


AeroSurfaceConfig
	1:1 with an aero surface, holds all the props like size/lift/drag


AeroSurface
	class that represents a wing surface, gets tied to a gameobject transform


AircraftPhysics
	class that iterates over each aero surface every frame, hits rigid body with calculated forces


----------------------------

Don't directly expose config class for each aero surface.  Make an enum then have a factory that returns configs
per enum (may also want to look at the size of the gameobject for chord and span)


Probably don't need to do much with flaps, instead use IK to turn it into more of a soft body plane


----------------------------


when the arms are straight out, the wings should be long like a glider, also reduce the throttle


when the arms are down at the sides, the wings should be smaller, also increase the throttle
