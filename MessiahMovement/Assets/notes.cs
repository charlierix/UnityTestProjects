    // After playing messiah again, Player isn't accurate.  The real one feels a little heavier - takes more
    // effort to get altitude

    // Make a second player and second set of scenes



    // Notes after playing the game:

    // On initial jump, you keep going up until you let go
    //  * may still want to have a little more height on initial jump than the game from first jump, but not a lot

    // After releasing, you need to keep pressing jump to flap the wings

    // Holding in doesn't glide




    // Only two types of sound are needed:
    //      foot steps
    //      wing flaps      <---- the speed/repetition varies

}
