Make a version that looks in a mods folder for jetpack bundles

Each bundle has settings for which modes to use and settings for those modes

Make a scene that creates/edits/tests/saves those bundles

-----------------


the disc flight is pretty dialed in.  Some of the accelerations should be increased based on speed


add a vrthruster that applies an antigravity when controller is near the center


need a way to visualize all forces acting on the body.  This will help people design/tweak profiles


recognize gestures
	- a rapid stroke should do a burst acceleration
	- both hands quickly straight back with wrists tilted down should be a strong thruster
To train, press a button to review and isolate the
last 6 six seconds of playtime.  Mark the action to train on and the desired response (from a list of actions)


with the current settings, keep upright is both too weak and too intrusive depending what you want to do.  These thrust only
actions need something to push against to get some bite, otherwise it's too drifty.  Keep upright is currently the only thing
available to push against.  A tail fin would be a great thing to have
