It looks like .gitignore needs to be at the root folder of each unity project - can't put it in this root folder

Note that a lot of the projects have a lib folder with dlls from PerfectlyNormalUnity project

## VR Flight Projects

These are attempts to make ironman style flight in vr.  Each of the projects focuses on a different style of  flight.  The final result would be something that blends them, choosing the appropriate flight style based on speed/orientation

- **Egg Balancing**

KeepUpright is always trying to keep the up pointed along 0,1,0 (but is weak to allow strong enough torques to roll/pitch/yaw the player)

The player holds hands in a neutral position, activates flight.  Then the current position/orientation of hands relative to zero applies various forces on the body

No aerodynamics, just a rigid body with simple drag


## Other Projects

- **Messhiah Movement**

Simple character controller, tried to emulate the flight from the game messiah

- **Mesh IK**

This was an attempt to have a mesh of nodes controlled by independent nodes.  This was likely copied/reworked from FastIK (I don't remember, it's something I did 2 years ago).  This was before I know about unity's IK

- **Rigging IK Custom Meshes**

This was an atempt to build custom skeletons for bodies

One of the scenes has various tests of different unity IK types

The other scenes log controller positions to be analyzed later.  I was trying to figure out how to dynamically determine the direction that the skeleton should be pointing based on hands/head
